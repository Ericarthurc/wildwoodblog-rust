# New Blog Site

Hey Wildwood Staff, I am excited to announce a cool new project I have been working on. As the IT guy around here, an important aspect of my job is to quickly and efficiently share new technological information that further develops a safe and working computer/network environment. I want to set every employee here up for success when it comes to working with our on-site networks and devices, but also your personal devices and home networks.

Over the past couple of years, I have emailed out some ‘IT memos’ that target our computer work flow here and promote safer internet habits. But, these memos can get very long, it’s hard to explain everything in text form, and there isn’t a single location to look back at previous memos.

## The Solution

I have been spending some time researching different solutions and options and I came up with, (don’t follow this web link just yet 😁) blog.wildwooddev. I am extremely excited about this new site! It solves all three of the issues I described… well maybe not the length problem... I have a lot to say at times.

This new site allows me to share information in a whole new way; in a much more efficient way! And it’s a central location for all previous and future memos to be viewed at any time.

## The Future

Starting with the next IT email memo I send out (hopefully soon), it will just contain a url link to the new site and that specific post. The emails will be more of a notification that a new post is up.

Well… <a href="https://blog.wildwooddev.com/blog/wild-memo-2021-7-5" target="_blank">now you can click this link!</a>
