# Mac Os Catalina 10.15

Hey Wildwood and WCA staff,
This email is for all the Mac computer users here on staff; mainly for those who use their Macs for their ministries, but this info is also good to know for your Mac at home. Apple is getting ready to release the first public version of MacOS Catalina 10.15; I just want everyone to have enough knowledge to know where or not upgrading is a good choice for you. This upgrade is nothing major or ground breaking when it comes to new features; it mostly just contains minor updates and fixes to Apple’s own software like Notes, Emails and Photos. Where we will see a big change that may affect you is Catalina is dropping support for 32-bit applications and only 64-bit applications will be supported from now on. You won’t need to know the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit and below I will explain how to check your current software for incompatibility.

## ProPresenter users

If your Mac device is being used for ProPresenter you are going to want to hold off on upgrading for now. ProPresenter 6 was built upon the MacOS 10.12 framework and they have been kind enough to patch support for up to 10.14.6 in. With that said though, there is currently no support for 10.15 and that is up to Renewed Vision (the creator) to add it. If there is a change with support I will let everyone know.

## Fiery Features users (custom print drivers in general)

With last year’s MacOS 10.14 update Apple changed the way print drivers are handled within their system print prompt and it completely messed up the usage of Fiery Features. The only current in-system workaround is to print through software not developed by Apple. But this workaround won’t last long as software companies update to support the new Apple print driver. We just saw this update with Google Chrome; in MacOS 10.14 and up Fiery Features are unusable in Chrome now; using Firefox to print from the web is the current workaround. With the 10.15 update they haven’t reverted this change which is a big bummer. For the creative team, currently the Adobe software can still print using Fiery Features.
I am watching diligently for a fix or suitable workaround. If Fiery Features are completely removed from Mac at some point, I will build a virtual Windows printer server which you can remote into and print from with Fiery. That’s not ideal but it will work. If you don’t want to be affected by this staying on 10.13 High Sierra is your best option.

## Checking your software for 32-bit applications

If you are interested in upgrading to Catalina 10.15 I would highly recommend checking your current software for incompatibility. Here are the steps to check:

1. Click the Apple icon in the top left of your screen
2. Click ‘About Mac’
3. Click ‘System Report’ on the bottom left of the ‘About Mac’ prompt
4. On the left scroll down to the ‘Software’ tab and click ‘Applications’
   This will give you a list of all your installed software. One of the top tabs will say ’64-Bit (Intel)’; all the software that says ‘No’ is 32-bit and will not work with Catalina. Side note: some of the Apple created Apps may says ‘No’ but they will get updated automatically to 64-bit with the update.
   General Compatibility
   With any update to a computer system it will take time to work out bugs and kinks. If you have important software that is 32-bit, hold off updating, but keep checking that software’s website for a 64-bit update. Companies want as many people as they can to use their software so they will work it out to get it working on Catalina.

## Conclusion

And as always if you have any questions or concerns please let me know and I will help you out.
