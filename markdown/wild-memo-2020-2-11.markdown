# Mac Users and Xerox C75

Hey Wildwood Staff;
I am sending this email out to address some of the issues going on these past weeks with the Main Office Printer. Before I dive too deep, if you’re a Windows user and having issues please just email me what’s going on your end; this email will just be targeting Mac users. As a lot of you know, Macs and the Main Office Printer have been in a long, love-hate relationship and neither Xerox or Apple has made it easier over the years. With every new version of Mac OS comes a slew of new issues with printing and Xerox seems to not really care. Luckily the amazing people at ‘EFI’ have continued to release new updates for our printer and really care about solving the issues that set us back. I am a big fan of keeping our software up to date and dislike having to stay on older versions of a system due to compatibility issues. And this leads me to some of the issues I saw this last week in regards to printing on the Main Office printer with a Mac computer.

With the release of Mac OS 10.14 Mojave, Apple moved to a new proprietary printing service called ‘Printer Features’. I talked a little bit about this in my last email about printing; all first party applications, Chrome and the latest versions of the Adobe programs moved over to the new ‘Printer Features’ service and this disallowed a lot of you from using ‘Fiery Features’ full feature set. To be candid about it, it was a horrible move by Apple and they really don’t care about the users on this one.

But, the amazing people at ‘EFI’ have really come through and released some new Mac Catalina patches and drivers to bypass the new Apple service and restore your ‘Fiery Features’. This is awesome news for us and so far, the patch works really well; I have already tested it on two Macs running Catalina.

## Mac OS 10.13 (High Sierra) and lower

Your printing should not have been affected in any way and you should still be able to print with ‘Fiery Features’. You can totally still use High Sierra if you want, but also feel free to go to Catalina, just read the part under 10.15 if you update. Side note, High Sierra is three years old now, if you’re considering updating please let me know.

## Mac OS 10.14 (Mojave)

You shouldn’t be having any problems printing, but you will not have access to ‘Fiery Features’ on first party applications, Chrome, and the latest 2020 versions of the Adobe programs (this list of applications will grow as software is updated). There is no patch for Mojave and so I recommend moving to Catalina, just read the part under 10.15 if you update. If you really like Mojave and want to stay there, but need ‘Fiery Features’ you can use the ‘EFI Command WorkStation’ software; I just highly don’t recommend it as of right now.

## Mac OS 10.15 (Catalina)

If you are on Catalina you need the new printer driver and the new patch. If you update to Catalina in the future, the old drivers will not work and you won’t be able to print. If I installed the Main Office printer drivers on your computer this January, you have the latest driver and should be okay to print. If you are on Catalina and have the latest print drivers and need access to ‘Fiery Features’ you will need the new patch.

As of right now I have already updated a lot of you to the new driver and have installed the patch for a couple of you. If you need either of them, please let me know as soon as possible and I will update your print drivers.

## Last Update

Also, really quick I wanted to address this again. It is really critical we are all printing in ‘black and white’ mode. On the Mac printer driver, I can’t force ‘black and white’ to default, you will need to select that option every time you print. I know it’s annoying and I am really sorry, it is just critical we are doing that. The church doesn’t pay for the ink, we pay per page side that is printed. Color copies cost the church a lot more then ‘black and white’ copies do; so, we want to be good stewards of what God has given us.

## Conclusion

Thanks for reading! If you have any questions please let me know.
