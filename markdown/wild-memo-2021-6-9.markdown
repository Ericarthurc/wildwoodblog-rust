# Browser Choice and Safety

Good afternoon Wildwood Staff, its been a couple months since I put out an IT memo and thought now was a good time to get back on the train. I try my best not to make these super long or drawn out, so today I will just touch on one important question; what web browser should you use? Over the past couple of years, the internet and browser market has exponentially grown and it can be difficult to know what to use and how to stay safe on the web. While I could sit here forever typing about what a web browser is and its history, I won’t do that to you, instead I will layout the more popular browser choices and then my recommendations.

## Browser market shares and browser engines:

There are thousands of publicly available web browsers today, but there are a few actually useable and popular ones. Here is a layout of the top web browsers and their global network usage <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank">market share</a> as of 2021:

1. Google Chrome – 77.03%
2. Apple Safari – 8.87%
3. Mozilla Firefox – 7.69%
4. Microsoft Edge – 5.83%
5. Microsoft Internet Explorer – 2.15%
6. Brave – 0.05%

As you can tell Google Chrome definitely has the lead by a very very very large margin… it’s not even close. And this is mostly due to the power of the ‘Chromium engine’, which is the leading JavaScript engine in the world. To touch on this point briefly, JavaScript is the backbone of the web browser and it is critical that it works well. Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox actually use different approaches to their browsers ‘engine’ and this can affect the users experience. Google is a very large company with some of the world’s top engineers, so they have the money and man power to design the world’s top browser engine.

## So what browser should I use?

So, should I use Google Chrome because it has the fastest engine and the highest market share? Well yes… and no… There are a ton of factors to consider when picking a browser, and while performance is important, so is security. It’s important to remember that the internet makes its money from data collection and harvesting. Have you ever wondered why your web browser is ‘free’; nowadays we just assume it should be free. But a lot of software costs a lot of money, and takes a long time to develop. Your web browser makes money off its market share usage and data collection partners. As consumers of the internet we generate revenue for web browser companies. The idea of internet data collection is a MASSIVE topic, and is too complex to explain all here; and in the future I would love to write about some of the different ways web browsers make money. For now, just know your web choices are funding these different projects and companies. So again, what web browser should I use?

## Chrome, Safari and Edge

All these browser companies have different strategies and agendas when it comes to data collection. Big tech like, Apple and Google have very aggressive data collection policies, but they also have the resources to create very high functioning products that are updated quickly. <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> is a fantastic browser and performs very highly, but Google will track your interests through it and Apple performs similar tracking with Safari. Microsoft just release their new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge" target="_blank">Edge</a> browser that actually uses the Google Chrome engine (Chromium), so it has high performance, but again your subject to Microsoft controlling the product and how they manage your information. Side note: Internet Explorer is a dead browser and will not be updated by Microsoft anymore, please don’t use it.

## Firefox

<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> is owned by the non-profit company Mozilla, and was once at the top of the market share list; being Internet Explorer’s biggest competitor in the early 2000s. So, what happened with Firefox? It’s a bummer but Mozilla as a company has been struggling for a while now, and Google’s dominance has definitely not helped it. The Firefox engine is slower and they have struggled to keep up; but it doesn’t mean Firefox is dead, they still serve almost 8% of the world. And Mozilla prides itself on being much more transparent with their data collection intensions and allows for opting out of all tracking. Firefox is definitely one of the ‘safer’ and more ‘private’ browsers you can use.

## Brave

<a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a> is a new name to the browser game and is already making pretty big noise in the market. Brave’s CEO is a man named, Brendan Eich, who was the original CEO of Mozilla, in their prime, and the original developer behind JavaScript. Let’s just say he is really smart. Brave, like Firefox, prides itself on being fully transparent with their users and has achieved a new paradigm for generating income with opt-in ads and a crypto currency called ‘BAT’. The Brave browser was also designed around the ‘Chromium’ engine, so you get the same performance of Google Chrome, just without all the Google tracking. Brave is also a fully ‘open-source’ project which means all aspects of the program can be investigated by anyone at any time (<a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core" target="_blank">Brave's code base</a>).

## So for the third time which browser should I use?

Honestly, use whatever browser you like and are comfortable with. Just please don’t use Internet Explorer... haha poor Internet Explorer. This memo was just too quick share some insight on the different kind of browsers and who are behind them; it’s good to know there are other options out there. I have my own personal opinions, and they definitely come out in my presentation of the browsers. In case you didn’t catch it by the way I presented it, I am a huge fan of the Brave browser. It fits my needs in pretty much every way, but it may not be right for you. 90% of internet safety is just having good internet habits; you will be tracked online and keeping that knowledge in the forefront of your mind while using the web can keep you safe. Ask yourself, “should I be giving this information away”? “Should I download and install this software?” Remember that the internet connects the whole world together, if your device uses internet in some way then it ‘digitally touches’ the world.

## Conclusion

If you have any questions about web browsers and internet safety, please let me know.
Your friendly neighborhood IT guy!
