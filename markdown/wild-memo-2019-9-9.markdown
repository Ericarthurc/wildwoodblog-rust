# Data Selling, Cookies and Vpn Hype

Hey Wildwood and WCA Staff!
It’s been awhile since I have sent out a world tech update; but I kind of like writing these and I hope it spreads more knowledge on safe internet practices. I fully believe knowledge is power and security when it comes to the internet. I will preface this by saying these updates can get super long so I will break it up into three parts regarding the topics and if you have time to read them, awesome; if not, all good :D. The overall theme I want to touch is internet data and ways we can be proactive in protecting our own data. Like I said in the past the internet is a super weird place. It has no true one creator, and is probably the fastest and largest growing infrastructure of anything to ever exist on Earth created by man. In 1985 AoL was formed, starting the first real consumer internet project; and at that point in history really nothing consumer even ran on the internet. It wasn’t until around 1995 companies like Google, Yahoo, Ebay, Amazon and others started showing up to the internet party. Side note, Google image search ‘Amazon’s website in 2000’, the internet has come a long way haha. At this time the internet was also very inaccessible and expensive to use; and there wasn’t a ‘mobile’ market. Using the internet required large and expensive desktop computers with an expensive modem card and then a subscription to AoL to actually use the internet. Fast forward to 2019 and 52% of all internet traffic in the world is done on a mobile device. Every single day the world creates 2.5 billion Gigabytes of data and it’s exponentially growing. With all that data floating around that leads me to the topic of how the internet makes money.

## Data Selling

In todays data centered, mobile, fast growing internet world money drives a lot of it. And when it comes to how the internet makes money the consumer suffers a lot here. Now there are millions of ways people are making money using the internet, but one of the most prominent is data selling. Data selling is when one company sells data to another company. Data is power on the internet. Say you are a small business that sells a product targeted to youth. You want to optimize where and when you advertise your product to draw in your target audience. So, you buy analytics data from say Google; the data tells your things like what sites are being used the most by your target audience and at what times they use these sites. This allows you to optimize when and where you advertise your product. This is how the internet runs and makes money; analytics data. The issue falls on how these companies get the data; what kinds of data are they saving and to who are they selling the data too. And this leads to the topic of cookies.

## Cookies

These aren’t the delicious kind you can eat… bummer; I mean I guess you could order cookies online, those would be internet cookies... Real web cookies are small pieces of data a website stores and saves either on your local computer or on an external database. Web cookies are a double edge sword though; they can do things like remember that you are logged into your email, but they can also do things like save your browsing history on a database. The bummer with web cookies is that they are pretty much unavoidable on pretty much every single website. But they also make using websites way more convenient. You can see this in action pretty easily. If you have a Facebook account, go to Facebook’s website and most likely you are already logged in. That’s because the first time you logged into Facebook their website saved a cookie on your computer containing your login information. Now open a new tab in ‘private’ or ‘incognito’ mode; go to Facebook’s website and you will be prompted to login every time. This is because ‘incognito mode’ or ‘private mode’ disable cookies in the browser, but using these modes will sacrifice pretty much all basic convenience of the modern internet. Tracking cookies are used by many websites as a way to gain analytics on your browsing habits. This is why you can search Amazon for the ‘Crayola Ultimate 152 Piece Crayon Set’ and then go on Twitter and get an ad for crayons. It’s not magic, it’s analytics data. Also keep in mind cookies aren’t the only way people get data from you. There are other methods and some of them I have talked about in the past; I just want to touch cookies this time.

## Vpn Hype and Being Safe

I really want to talk about VPN hype for a second. VPN’s are becoming way more popular today and it’s mostly because of the data money grab. If you don’t know what a VPN is, it is a way to mask your own internet traffic through someone else. VPN stands for virtual private networking; and it’s basically a virtual internet that plays by its own rules. The hard part is if you use a VPN you are subject to the VPN providers rules, so you have to be really careful in picking a VPN provider. But VPNs are a really good way to protect yourself on the internet. For example, you are at a Coffee Shop and using their open wifi; open wifis are not encrypted so anyone on that network can ‘packet sniff’ your data; using a VPN will encrypt your data on that open network though. Now say you never use open wifi networks (I wouldn’t without a VPN) and you only really use your network at home; a VPN can also benefit you in that situation. The VPN will encrypt your data and pass through your ISP (internet service provider, probably Frontier or Spectrum) and they can’t see what your doing on the web. ISP’s make a large amount of money selling their own users web data to companies like Google. With all of that, a VPN service is a great tool but it’s not the end all solution to internet safety; there are cons to using a VPN, but I won’t touch on that right now. Best practice is to remember; anything you enter into a website is saved forever. If you aren’t comfortable giving away that information, then don’t. You might be totally fine with your browser history and analytics being use for advertisement, and that’s totally fine. My job is just to inform; like I said in the beginning, the internet is one of, if not the fastest growing infrastructure in the world. No one person makes the decisions on how the internet is ran. It’s almost like a giant snowball that keeps rolling and getting bigger and bigger; no one can stop it now so we kind of just figure out ways to deal with it better. People will take advantage of the state of the data world and seek to exploit it. But there are companies and people out there still fighting for the freedom of the internet; the freedom of user’s data.

## Conclusion

So to sum it all up, the TLDR version, what we do on the internet is always being watched and saved. Companies capitalize on this to make money. There are tools available to help prevent your data being sold; but still best practice is to just be cautious of what you give away on the web.

Thanks for reading! Your friendly neighborhood IT guy!
